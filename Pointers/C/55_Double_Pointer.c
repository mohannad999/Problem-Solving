- Double Pointers are a pointer to pointer 
- Must use the ** in declarations 
- Used to set value of a pointer address
   - single dereference accesses pointer address
   - Douple dereference accesses pointer data

/*
Void Pointers are used to track generic addresses. 
Double Pointers allow us to change the address a pointer holds. 
The Restrict keyword allows the compiler to optimize our code more. 
These concepts are somewhat confusing the first time you learn them, 
but are regularly used in software development.
